    <p>
      Hi, I'm Sean. I'm a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> 
      developer from Apex, North Carolina. I'm the founder and only employee of 
      Shiro Labs and currently employed fulltime at
      <a href="http://speeddigital.com">SpeedDigital</a>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I see programming as a craft, and like any serious craftsman, I dedicate as
      much time as I am able to make sure that I'm up to date on modern best practices 
      of software development. I'm a big proponent of OOP and TDD where applicable,
      and I value a streamlined development environment that 
      lets me concentrate on writing well tested, clean, and maintainable code.
    </p>
    <p>
    I've been programming in Ruby and Rails now for 
    <script>var d= new Date().getFullYear() - 2011;document.write(d)</script> 
    years and have recently been dabbling in 
    <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> and <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>. 
    When I'm not programming, I can usually be found listening to music while 
    gulping down unhealthy amounts of coffee.
